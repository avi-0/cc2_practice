This is my go at a practice mod for Celeste Classic 2. Very hacky and sacrifices a bunch of graphics for tokens. Has a level mode (get from the start of the level to the finish, you can respawn at checkpoints and keep timer going) and a checkpoint mode (get from a specified checkpoint to any other checkpoint). Optimizes the loading of levels so you can select them faster.

Controls:

* S/D to switch levels/checkpoints
* W to toggle level/checkpoint mode
* Shift to restart (dying doesn't count in level mode if you touched a checkpoint)
